# Bioinformatics Practice

This repository contains practice work demonstrating essential bioinformatics skills.  
It includes sequence retrieval, multiple sequence alignment, and protein property analysis.

## Contents

### 1. Sequence_Retrieval
- FASTA file downloaded from NCBI.
- Notes on accession numbers.
- Basic sequence handling.

### 2. Alignments
- Multiple sequence alignment performed using MEGA.
- Alignment output file.
- Notes on conserved regions and motifs.

### 3. Protein_Properties
- Physicochemical property analysis using ProtParam.
- Molecular weight, instability index, aliphatic index, etc.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a space to practise and demonstrate core bioinformatics techniques needed for genomics, proteomics, and immunology-focused research.
